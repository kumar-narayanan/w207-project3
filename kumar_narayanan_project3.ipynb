    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "The `sklearn` documentation on feature extraction may be useful:\n",

    "- Make sure to answer every part in every question.\n",

    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning keep things in functions).\n",

    "The KNN model won't work so well. We've over 25K features. The idea behind KNN is to compare the item with K nearest neighbors, and pick the one type that has most match. In the case of documents this methods works only when the dev data conatins doc. that are nearly identical to one of the training data set entries. Given that each document contains only a small subset of the entire vocabulary (case of sparse matrix compared to a reasonable matrix used with hand-written digits pixel image) KNN isn't able to a great job of figuring out possible right neigbhors. In other words, if you go well beyond these neighbors there may be a better match. The sparsity of the array that represent each of the document doesn't help in KNN calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression does better than KNN, but not as good as MultinomialNB. For items like documents which trun into a sparse matrix when features are transformed into numbers, the concept of counting the number of each word in each document and comparing it with the training is a good way to match. Logistic regression is starting with a hyperplane and trying to tweak the intercept and slope of the hyperplane to maximize likelihood. This is a slower process compared to MultinomiaNB. It may also be due to the inherent different in generative model (Naive Bayes) Vs Discriminative Model (Logistic Regression).\n",

    "### Question 6: L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",

    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",

Given our prune proceudre (of dropping all words which have 0 coefficients for all class labels), a low value of C has, in general bad performance, and given that we eliminated all those that have 0 coefficient value, the prunded model is doing a bit better. \n",

Barring a couple of C values the full vocabulary has higher F1 score but it's not significantly different. Compared to the significant vocbulary size reduction the F1 score isn't going down a whole lot. At C=2.0 the difference between the two F1 scores is 0.004, and the pruned case is tiny bit better."

    "***Question 3***: What does R Ratio mean?\n",
    "R-Ratio is the ratio of the max probability of each row of the predictor's probability matrix upon the probability of the label actually predicted. The maxtrix, in the specific case, has as many rows as the number of DEV Labels, and has 4 columns, one corresponding to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value in the position (i, j) is the probability that the predicted label value, correpsonding to the ith predicted value, being class j. The model examines each row, and whichever column in that row has the highest value (probability) the predicted label will be that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio should be 1, if the ith predicted value and the ith DEV lable (which was used to predict) are identical. Otherwise, the R-Ratio (always >= 1) is an indication of how far we've strayed from the true value. If R is high it indicates that the model strongly believe in the predicted value (which has the highest probability) and such a belief is off from the truth by a huge value - being ratio of the (probaility) of predicted label to that of the actual label.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question 4***\n",
    "When we look at the docs that have the highest R ratio (i.e model strongly believed in it, but the actual label class has a low probability per the model's fit) we see the following:\n",
    "- Doc. 1 has both relegious and computer related items. This doc. is a candidate for misclassification. There seems to be words that have both significance in reltion and computers.\n",
    "- Doc. 2 again has the same problem as the 1st one - it's a pretty shory doc., and has more computer related words than relegious words.\n",
    "- Doc. 3 is indeed a small doc. Without correlation of words it's difficult to classify this doc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for improvements, one option is to exclude words that can two or more interpretations. Thus, if we remove these features we might see the model fit a bit more correctly. A 2nd option is to use the \"stop_words\" option in the TfidfVectorizer() call, with a stop word list set to ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS.\n"
